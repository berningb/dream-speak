## 🔧 Dream Workflow (Optional)

The Add Dream flow uses a conversational workflow powered by:

- **DeepSeek (deepseek-chat)**: Helps pull dream details through follow-up questions. Context caching automatically reduces costs for repeated prompts.
- **Google Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)**: Generates dream images from your description via the [@google/genai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/genai) SDK.

Add these to your `.env` to enable the workflow:

- `VITE_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` – from [DeepSeek API](https://platform.deepseek.com)
- `VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` – from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### AI Usage Limits

To protect against runaway API costs, per-user daily limits are enforced. Defaults (overridable via `.env`):

- `VITE_AI_LIMIT_CHAT` – chat messages (default: 30/day)
- `VITE_AI_LIMIT_EXTRACT` – dream extraction (default: 10/day)
- `VITE_AI_LIMIT_INTERPRET` – dream interpretation (default: 20/day)
- `VITE_AI_LIMIT_DESCRIBE` – AI expansion (default: 10/day)
- `VITE_AI_LIMIT_IMAGE` – image generation (default: 5/day)

Limits reset at midnight UTC. Set to `0` to disable a feature.
